# Project Title

Travel Studio

## Getting Started

Travel Studio is an online app that can search for places near your location or any location in the world.

## How does it works?

It uses Geolocation (html5) to get user location, also the option to manually set the location is available with Google Maps Autocomplete, after that user can search for places or words like "pizza" and it will return 20 results. 

## How can I use it?

You can download this project and use it with your own Google Places API / Google Maps API keys.
